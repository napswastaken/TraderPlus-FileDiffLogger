## About The Project



<h3 align="center">Overview:</h3> 
 DZSA & Magic love to remove servers from their server list at random, this stops that happening by quering the server every 10 minutes & sends a message to a Discord webhook wit the time and date. Due to limutations with JSON Formatting and Batch scripting, I can't send %API_RESPONSE% to Discord, so even though a message is sent to Discord, does not mean the response from the API is sucessful.
